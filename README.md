# Electronic Tests and Measurements Course Projects  

Welcome to the **Electronic Tests and Measurements** course repository! This public repository is designed to showcase practical projects that apply the concepts learned throughout the term.  

## 📚 Course Overview  
The **Electronic Tests and Measurements** course focuses on essential concepts in electronics, demonstrated through hands-on projects. Key topics include:  
- **Filters**: Designing and analyzing high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, and band-stop filters.  
- **Modulation Techniques**: Simulating and understanding AM and PM modulation.  
- **Audio Amplification**: Designing and testing circuits for audio amplifiers.  

## 🛠 Tools and Software  
- **Multisim**: The primary simulation tool used for designing, testing, and analyzing circuits.  

## 📁 Repository Structure  
Each project is organized into folders, typically containing:  
1. **Simulation Files**: `.ms13` files compatible with Multisim.  
2. **Circuit Diagrams**: Images or screenshots of the circuits included in the Multisim files.  
3. **Readings Comparison Media**: Photos or tables highlighting key differences, such as between band-pass and band-stop filters.  
4. **Hardware Implementation Media**: Photos or videos showcasing breadboard circuit testing (where applicable).
